Project Name: HTML Recipe Collection
Introduction
The current project, HTML Recipe Collection, aims to showcase a collection of recipes using HTML. By completing this project, I will demonstrate proficiency in HTML coding and the ability to create well-structured web pages.

Features
Recipe Listing: The project will include a collection of various recipes, each displayed on a separate web page.
Recipe Details: Each recipe page will provide detailed instructions, ingredients, cooking time, and any additional relevant information.
Navigation: Users will be able to navigate between recipe pages using a menu or links.
Responsive Design: The web pages will be designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices.

Usage
Once the project is set up, you can browse through the recipe collection by opening any recipe page in your web browser. Each page will provide the necessary information to recreate the specific dish.
